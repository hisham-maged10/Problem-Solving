Maximum Pairwise Product Problem
Find the maximum product of two distinct numbers
in a sequence of non-negative integers.
Input: A sequence of non-negative
integers.
Output: The maximum value that
can be obtained by multiplying

Note that i and j should be different, though it may be the case that ai = aj .
Input format. The first line contains an integer n. The next line contains
n non-negative integers a1; : : : ;an (separated by spaces).
Output format. The maximum pairwise product.
Constraints. 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; 0 <= a1; : : : ;an <= 2 * 10^5.
